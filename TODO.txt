Alternate between sprite index 0 and 1 - DONE 
Put in Joe music. PUT IN, but unloading causes problems on looping.
Mimics skeleton boss - DONE

Put in correct pixel sheet width and height.

Create sprite and weapons for each major president:
- George Washington. Musket rifle and he can ride a horse. Will mimic headless horsemen npc look.
- Donald Trump. Will mimic moon lord - ultimate boss. Weapons are maga flags flying around.
- Joe Biden (when he was in the primary). Will be like a skeleton. Maybe will shoot vaccines out of his
eyes. Open to suggestions.
